## NextJS + Ant Design Boilerplate ([Live](https://www.tms.preview/))

A starter **NextJS + AntDesign + TS** boilerplate for React Projects w/ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

`Less` is supported by [next-plugin-antd-less](https://github.com/SolidZORO/next-plugin-antd-less). The boilerplate has been inspired by SolidZORO's mkn.

State-management has been provided by [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). The official redux website also [recommends this](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview#redux-toolkit). It is nothing but a opinionated, boiler-code-included toolset for efficient Redux development.

Dark-mode and light-mode are implemented on a very core level (component level), so that each component can be styled accordingly in the future if any such requirement arises.

`/src/interfaces` contains all the types/interfaces we are going to be using within this project.

General configurations of the app's env, libraries can be found in `/src/configs`.

The latest react-hooks concepts are woven wihtin this boileplate itself, so a basic knowledge of that is a must.

Whole project is written in **TypeScript** for thorough type-checking, prop-typing and code maintainence readily while writing code.
